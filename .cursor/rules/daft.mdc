### Read From a Data Source
Daft supports both local paths as well as paths to object storage such as AWS S3:

CSV files: daft.read_csv("s3://path/to/bucket/*.csv")
Parquet files: daft.read_parquet("/path/*.parquet")
JSON line-delimited files: daft.read_json("/path/*.json")
Files on disk: daft.from_glob_path("/path/*.jpeg")

Daft DataFrames are lazy by default. This means that the contents will not be computed (“materialized”) unless you explicitly tell Daft to do so. This is best practice for working with larger-than-memory datasets and parallel/distributed architectures.

The file we have just loaded only has 5 rows. You can materialize the whole DataFrame in memory easily using the df.collect() method:


🐍 Python

df.collect()

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | DoB        | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Date       | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto    | Evergreen | 34    | 1990-04-03 | Canada         | true    |
| James      | Jale      | 62    | 1962-03-24 | Canada         | true    |
| Wolfgang   | Winter    | 23    | 2001-02-12 | Germany        | None    |
| Shandra    | Shamas    | 57    | 1967-01-02 | United Kingdom | true    |
| Zaya       | Zaphora   | 40    | 1984-04-07 | United Kingdom | true    |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
To view just the first few rows, you can use the df.show() method:


🐍 Python

df.show(3)

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | DoB        | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Date       | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto    | Evergreen | 34    | 1990-04-03 | Canada         | true    |
| James      | Jale      | 62    | 1962-03-24 | Canada         | true    |
| Wolfgang   | Winter    | 23    | 2001-02-12 | Germany        | None    |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 3 of 5 rows)
Now let's take a look at some common DataFrame operations.

Select Columns#
You can select specific columns from your DataFrame with the df.select() method:


🐍 Python

df.select("first_name", "has_dog").show()

Output

+------------+---------+
| first_name | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Boolean |
+------------+---------+
| Ernesto    | true    |
| James      | true    |
| Wolfgang   | None    |
| Shandra    | true    |
| Zaya       | true    |
+------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
Select Rows#
You can filter rows using the df.where() method that takes an Logical Expression predicate input. In this case, we call the df.col() method that refers to the column with the provided name age:


🐍 Python

df.where(daft.col("age") >= 40).show()

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | DoB        | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Date       | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| James      | Jale      | 62    | 1962-03-24 | Canada         | true    |
| Shandra    | Shamas    | 57    | 1967-01-02 | United Kingdom | true    |
| Zaya       | Zaphora   | 40    | 1984-04-07 | United Kingdom | true    |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
Filtering can give you powerful optimization when you are working with partitioned files or tables. Daft will use the predicate to read only the necessary partitions, skipping any data that is not relevant.

Note

As mentioned earlier that our Parquet file is partitioned on the country column, this means that queries with a country predicate will benefit from query optimization.

Exclude Data#
You can limit the number of rows in a DataFrame by calling the df.limit() method:


🐍 Python

df.limit(2).show()

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | DoB        | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Date       | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto    | Evergreen | 34    | 1990-04-03 | Canada         | true    |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 1 of 1 rows)
To drop columns from the DataFrame, use the df.exclude() method.


🐍 Python

df.exclude("DoB").show()

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto    | Evergreen | 34    | Canada         | true    |
| James      | Jale      | 62    | Canada         | true    |
| Wolfgang   | Winter    | 23    | Germany        | None    |
| Shandra    | Shamas    | 57    | United Kingdom | true    |
| Zaya       | Zaphora   | 40    | United Kingdom | true    |
+------------+-----------+-------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
Transform Columns with Expressions#
Expressions are an API for defining computation that needs to happen over columns. For example, use the daft.col() expressions together with the with_column method to create a new column called full_name, joining the contents from the last_name column with the first_name column:


🐍 Python

df = df.with_column("full_name", daft.col("first_name") + " " + daft.col("last_name"))
df.select("full_name", "age", "country", "has_dog").show()

Output

+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
| full_name         | age   | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8              | Int64 | Utf8           | Boolean |
+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto Evergreen | 34    | Canada         | true    |
| James Jale        | 62    | Canada         | true    |
| Wolfgang Winter   | 23    | Germany        | None    |
| Shandra Shamas    | 57    | United Kingdom | true    |
| Zaya Zaphora      | 40    | United Kingdom | true    |
+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
Alternatively, you can also run your column transformation using Expressions directly inside your df.select() method*:


🐍 Python

df.select((daft.col("first_name").alias("full_name") + " " + daft.col("last_name")), "age", "country", "has_dog").show()

Output

+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
| full_name         | age   | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8              | Int64 | Utf8           | Boolean |
+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
| Ernesto Evergreen | 34    | Canada         | true    |
| James Jale        | 62    | Canada         | true    |
| Wolfgang Winter   | 23    | Germany        | None    |
| Shandra Shamas    | 57    | United Kingdom | true    |
| Zaya Zaphora      | 40    | United Kingdom | true    |
+-------------------+-------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
Sort Data#
You can sort a DataFrame with the df.sort(), in this example we chose to sort in ascending order:


🐍 Python

df.sort(daft.col("age"), desc=False).show()

Output

+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| first_name | last_name | age   | DoB        | country        | has_dog |
| Utf8       | Utf8      | Int64 | Date       | Utf8           | Boolean |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
| Wolfgang   | Winter    | 23    | 2001-02-12 | Germany        | None    |
| Ernesto    | Evergreen | 34    | 1990-04-03 | Canada         | true    |
| Zaya       | Zaphora   | 40    | 1984-04-07 | United Kingdom | true    |
| Shandra    | Shamas    | 57    | 1967-01-02 | United Kingdom | true    |
| James      | Jale      | 62    | 1962-03-24 | Canada         | true    |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+----------------+---------+
(Showing first 5 of 5 rows)
Group and Aggregate Data#
You can group and aggregate your data using the df.groupby() and the df.agg() methods. A groupby aggregation operation over a dataset happens in 2 steps:

Split the data into groups based on some criteria using df.groupby()
Specify how to aggregate the data for each group using df.agg()

🐍 Python

grouped = df.groupby("country").agg(
    daft.col("age").mean().alias("avg_age"),
    daft.col("has_dog").count()
).show()

Output

+----------------+---------+---------+
| country        | avg_age | has_dog |
| Utf8           | Float64 | UInt64  |
+----------------+---------+---------+
| Canada         | 48      | 2       |
| Germany        | 23      | 0       |
| United Kingdom | 48.5    | 2       |
+----------------+---------+---------+
(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
Note

The df.alias() method renames the given column.

Common data operations that you would perform on DataFrames are:

Filtering rows: Use df.where(...) to keep only the rows that meet certain conditions.
Creating new columns: Use df.with_column(...) to add a new column based on calculations from existing ones.
Joining DataFrames: Use df.join(other_df, ...) to combine two DataFrames based on common columns.
Sorting: Use df.sort(...) to arrange your data based on values in one or more columns.
Grouping and aggregating: Use df.groupby(...).agg(...) to summarize your data by groups.

When you call methods on a Daft Dataframe, it defers the work by adding to an internal "plan". You can examine the current plan of a DataFrame by calling df.explain()!

Passing the show_all=True argument will show you the plan after Daft applies its query optimizations and the physical (lower-level) plan.


Plan Output

== Unoptimized Logical Plan ==

* Project: col(A), col(B), col(C)
|
* Source:
|   Number of partitions = 1
|   Output schema = A#Int64, B#Float64, C#Boolean, D#Null


== Optimized Logical Plan ==

* Project: col(A), col(B), col(C)
|
* Source:
|   Number of partitions = 1
|   Output schema = A#Int64, B#Float64, C#Boolean, D#Null


== Physical Plan ==

|   Clustering spec = { Num partitions = 1 }
|
* InMemoryScan:
|   Schema = A#Int64, B#Float64, C#Boolean, D#Null,
|   Size bytes = 65,
|   Clustering spec = { Num partitions = 1 }


When should I materialize my DataFrame?#
If you "eagerly" call df.collect() immediately on every DataFrame, you may run into issues:

If data is too large at any step, materializing all of it may cause memory issues
Optimizations are not possible since we cannot "predict future operations"
However, data science is all about experimentation and trying different things on the same data. This means that materialization is crucial when working interactively with DataFrames, since it speeds up all subsequent experimentation on that DataFrame.

We suggest materializing DataFrames using df.collect() when they contain expensive operations (e.g. sorts or expensive function calls) and have to be called multiple times by downstream code:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = df.sort("A")  # expensive sort
df.collect()  # materialize the DataFrame

# All subsequent work on df avoids recomputing previous steps
df.sum("B").show()
df.mean("B").show()
df.with_column("try_this", df["A"] + 1).show(5)

### OR w/ SQL

df = daft.sql("SELECT * FROM df ORDER BY A")
df.collect()

# All subsequent work on df avoids recomputing previous steps
daft.sql("SELECT sum(B) FROM df").show()
daft.sql("SELECT mean(B) FROM df").show()
daft.sql("SELECT *, (A + 1) AS try_this FROM df").show(5)


In many other cases however, there are better options than materializing your entire DataFrame with df.collect():

Peeking with df.show(N): If you only want to "peek" at the first few rows of your data for visualization purposes, you can use df.show(N), which processes and shows only the first N rows.
Writing to disk: The df.write_* methods will process and write your data to disk per-partition, avoiding materializing it all in memory at once.
Pruning data: You can materialize your DataFrame after performing a df.limit(), df.where() or df.select() operation which processes your data or prune it down to a smaller size.

Schemas and Types#
Notice also that when we printed our DataFrame, Daft displayed its schema. Each column of your DataFrame has a name and a type, and all data in that column will adhere to that type!

Daft can display your DataFrame's schema without materializing it. Under the hood, it performs intelligent sampling of your data to determine the appropriate schema, and if you make any modifications to your DataFrame it can infer the resulting types based on the operation.

Note

Under the hood, Daft represents data in the Apache Arrow format, which allows it to efficiently represent and work on data using high-performance kernels which are written in Rust.

Sometimes, it may be useful to exclude certain columns from a DataFrame. This can be done with df.exclude():


🐍 Python

df.exclude("A").show()

Output

+---------+
|       B |
|   Int64 |
+=========+
|       4 |
+---------+
|       5 |
+---------+
|       6 |
+---------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
Adding a new column can be achieved with df.with_column():


🐍 Python

df.with_column("C", df["A"] + df["B"]).show()

Output

+---------+---------+---------+
|       A |       B |       C |
|   Int64 |   Int64 |   Int64 |
+=========+=========+=========+
|       1 |       4 |       5 |
+---------+---------+---------+
|       2 |       5 |       7 |
+---------+---------+---------+
|       3 |       6 |       9 |
+---------+---------+---------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
Selecting Columns Using Wildcards#
We can select multiple columns at once using wildcards. The expression col("*") selects every column in a DataFrame, and you can operate on this expression in the same way as a single column:


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
df.select(col("*") * 3).show()

Output

╭───────┬───────╮
│ A     ┆ B     │
│ ---   ┆ ---   │
│ Int64 ┆ Int64 │
╞═══════╪═══════╡
│ 3     ┆ 12    │
├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 6     ┆ 15    │
├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 9     ┆ 18    │
╰───────┴───────╯
We can also select multiple columns within structs using col("struct")["*"]:


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "A": [
        {"B": 1, "C": 2},
        {"B": 3, "C": 4}
    ]
})
df.select(col("A")["*"]).show()

Output

╭───────┬───────╮
│ B     ┆ C     │
│ ---   ┆ ---   │
│ Int64 ┆ Int64 │
╞═══════╪═══════╡
│ 1     ┆ 2     │
├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 3     ┆ 4     │
╰───────┴───────╯
Under the hood, wildcards work by finding all of the columns that match, then copying the expression several times and replacing the wildcard. This means that there are some caveats:

Only one wildcard is allowed per expression tree. This means that col("*") + col("*") and similar expressions do not work.
Be conscious about duplicated column names. Any code like df.select(col("*"), col("*") + 3) will not work because the wildcards expand into the same column names.
For the same reason, col("A") + col("*") will not work because the name on the left-hand side is inherited, meaning all the output columns are named A, causing an error if there is more than one. However, col("*") + col("A") will work fine.

Combining DataFrames#
Two DataFrames can be column-wise joined using df.join().

This requires a "join key", which can be supplied as the on argument if both DataFrames have the same name for their key columns, or the left_on and right_on argument if the key column has different names in each DataFrame.

Daft also supports multi-column joins if you have a join key comprising of multiple columns!


🐍 Python

df1 = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
df2 = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "C": [7, 8, 9]})

df1.join(df2, on="A").show()

Output

+---------+---------+---------+
|       A |       B |       C |
|   Int64 |   Int64 |   Int64 |
+=========+=========+=========+
|       1 |       4 |       7 |
+---------+---------+---------+
|       2 |       5 |       8 |
+---------+---------+---------+
|       3 |       6 |       9 |
+---------+---------+---------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
Reordering Rows#
Rows in a DataFrame can be reordered based on some column using df.sort(). Daft also supports multi-column sorts for sorting on multiple columns at once.


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "A": [1, 2, 3],
    "B": [6, 7, 8],
})

df.sort("A", desc=True).show()

Output

+---------+---------+
|       A |       B |
|   Int64 |   Int64 |
+=========+=========+
|       3 |       8 |
+---------+---------+
|       2 |       7 |
+---------+---------+
|       1 |       6 |
+---------+---------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
Numbering Rows#
Daft provides monotonically_increasing_id(), which assigns unique, increasing IDs to rows in a DataFrame, especially useful in distributed settings, by:

Using the upper 28 bits for the partition number
Using the lower 36 bits for the row number within each partition
This allows for up to 268 million partitions and 68 billion rows per partition. It's useful for creating unique IDs in distributed DataFrames, tracking row order after operations like sorting, and ensuring uniqueness across large datasets.


import daft
from daft.functions import monotonically_increasing_id

# Initialize the RayRunner to run distributed
daft.context.set_runner_ray()

# Create a DataFrame and repartition it into 2 partitions
df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3, 4]}).into_partitions(2)

# Add unique IDs
df = df.with_column("id", monotonically_increasing_id())
df.show()
Output

╭───────┬─────────────╮
│ A     ┆ id          │
│ ---   ┆ ---         │
│ Int64 ┆ UInt64      │

├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤

╰───────┴─────────────╯
In this example, rows in the first partition get IDs 0 and 1, while rows in the second partition start at 2^36 (68719476736).

Exploding Columns#
The df.explode() method can be used to explode a column containing a list of values into multiple rows. All other rows will be duplicated.


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "A": [1, 2, 3],
    "B": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
})

df.explode("B").show()

Output

+---------+---------+
|       A |       B |
|   Int64 |   Int64 |
+=========+=========+
|       1 |       1 |

Expressions#
Expressions are how you can express computations that should be run over columns of data.

Creating Expressions#
Referring to a column in a DataFrame#
Most commonly you will be creating expressions by using the daft.col function.


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

daft.sql_expr("A")

Output

col(A)
The above code creates an Expression that refers to a column named "A".

Using SQL#
Daft can also parse valid SQL as expressions.


⚙️ SQL

daft.sql_expr("A + 1")

Output

col(A) + lit(1)
The above code will create an expression representing "the column named 'x' incremented by 1". For many APIs, sql_expr will actually be applied for you as syntactic sugar!

Literals#
You may find yourself needing to hardcode a "single value" oftentimes as an expression. Daft provides a lit() helper to do so:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

# Refers to an expression which always evaluates to 42
daft.sql_expr("42")

Output

lit(42)
This special :func:~daft.expressions.lit expression we just created evaluates always to the value 42.
Wildcard Expressions#
You can create expressions on multiple columns at once using a wildcard. The expression col("*")) selects every column in a DataFrame, and you can operate on this expression in the same way as a single column:


🐍 Python

import daft
from daft import col

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
df.select(col("*") * 3).show()

Output

Wildcards also work very well for accessing all members of a struct column:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

import daft

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "person": [
        {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
        {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
        {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
    ]
})

# Access all fields of the 'person' struct using SQL
daft.sql("SELECT person.* FROM df").show()

Output

╭──────────┬───────╮
│ name     ┆ age   │
│ ---      ┆ ---   │
│ String   ┆ Int64 │
╞══════════╪═══════╡

╰──────────┴───────╯
In this example, we use the wildcard * to access all fields of the person struct column. This is equivalent to selecting each field individually (person.name, person.age), but is more concise and flexible, especially when dealing with structs that have many fields.

Composing Expressions#
Numeric Expressions#
Since column "A" is an integer, we can run numeric computation such as addition, division and checking its value. Here are some examples where we create new columns using the results of such computations:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        *,
        A + 1 AS A_add_one,
        A / 2.0 AS A_divide_two,
        A > 1 AS A_gt_1
    FROM df
""")
df.collect()

Output

+---------+-------------+----------------+-----------+
|       A |   A_add_one |   A_divide_two | A_gt_1    |
|   Int64 |       Int64 |        Float64 | Boolean   |
+=========+=============+================+===========+
|       1 |           2 |            0.5 | false     |
+---------+-------------+----------------+-----------+
|       2 |           3 |            1   | true      |
+---------+-------------+----------------+-----------+
|       3 |           4 |            1.5 | true      |
+---------+-------------+----------------+-----------+
(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
Notice that the returned types of these operations are also well-typed according to their input types. For example, calling df["A"] > 1 returns a column of type Boolean.

Both the Float and Int types are numeric types, and inherit many of the same arithmetic Expression operations. You may find the full list of numeric operations in the Expressions API Reference.

String Expressions#
Daft also lets you have columns of strings in a DataFrame. Let's take a look!


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"B": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]})
df.show()

Output

+--------+
| B      |
| Utf8   |
+========+
| foo    |
+--------+
| bar    |
+--------+
| baz    |
+--------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
Unlike the numeric types, the string type does not support arithmetic operations such as * and /. The one exception to this is the + operator, which is overridden to concatenate two string expressions as is commonly done in Python. Let's try that!


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.sql("SELECT *, B + 'foo' AS B2 FROM df")
df.show()

Output

+--------+--------+
| B      | B2     |
| Utf8   | Utf8   |
+========+========+
| foo    | foofoo |
+--------+--------+
| bar    | barfoo |
+--------+--------+
| baz    | bazfoo |
+--------+--------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
There are also many string operators that are accessed through a separate .str.* "method namespace".

For example, to check if each element in column "B" contains the substring "a", we can use the .str.contains method:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.sql("SELECT *, contains(B2, B) AS B2_contains_B FROM df")
df.show()

Output

+--------+--------+-----------------+
| B      | B2     | B2_contains_B   |
| Utf8   | Utf8   | Boolean         |
+========+========+=================+
| foo    | foofoo | true            |
+--------+--------+-----------------+
| bar    | barfoo | true            |
+--------+--------+-----------------+
| baz    | bazfoo | true            |
+--------+--------+-----------------+
(Showing first 3 rows)
You may find a full list of string operations in the Expressions API Reference.

URL Expressions#
One special case of a String column you may find yourself working with is a column of URL strings.

Daft provides the .url.* method namespace with functionality for working with URL strings. For example, to download data from URLs:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "urls": [
        "https://www.google.com",
        "s3://daft-public-data/open-images/validation-images/0001eeaf4aed83f9.jpg",
    ],
})
df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        urls,
        url_download(urls) AS data
    FROM df
""")
df.collect()

Output

+----------------------+----------------------+
| urls                 | data                 |
| Utf8                 | Binary               |
+======================+======================+
| https://www.google.c | b'<!doctype          |
| om                   | html><html           |
|                      | itemscope="" itemtyp |
|                      | e="http://sche...    |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| s3://daft-public-    | b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x |
| data/open-           | 00\x10JFIF\x00\x01\x |
| images/validation-   | 01\x01\x00H\x00H\... |
| images/0001e...      |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+
(Showing first 2 of 2 rows)
This works well for URLs which are HTTP paths to non-HTML files (e.g. jpeg), local filepaths or even paths to a file in an object store such as AWS S3 as well!

JSON Expressions#
If you have a column of JSON strings, Daft provides the .json.* method namespace to run JQ-style filters on them. For example, to extract a value from a JSON object:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "json": [
        '{"a": 1, "b": 2}',
        '{"a": 3, "b": 4}',
    ],
})
df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        json,
        json_query(json, '.a') AS a
    FROM df
""")
df.collect()

Output

╭──────────────────┬──────╮
│ json             ┆ a    │
│ ---              ┆ ---  │

│ {"a": 3, "b": 4} ┆ 3    │
╰──────────────────┴──────╯

(Showing first 2 of 2 rows)
Daft uses jaq as the underlying executor, so you can find the full list of supported filters in the jaq documentation.

Logical Expressions#
Logical Expressions are an expression that refers to a column of type Boolean, and can only take on the values True or False.


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"C": [True, False, True]})

Daft supports logical operations such as & (and) and | (or) between logical expressions.

Comparisons#
Many of the types in Daft support comparisons between expressions that returns a Logical Expression.

For example, here we can compare if each element in column "A" is equal to elements in column "B":


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [1, 2, 4]})

df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        A,
        B,
        A = B AS A_eq_B
    FROM df
""")

df.collect()

Output

╭───────┬───────┬─────────╮
│ A     ┆ B     ┆ A_eq_B  │
│ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---     │
│ Int64 ┆ Int64 ┆ Boolean │

│ 3     ┆ 4     ┆ false   │
╰───────┴───────┴─────────╯

(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
Other useful comparisons can be found in the Expressions API Reference.

If Else Pattern#
The .if_else() method is a useful expression to have up your sleeve for choosing values between two other expressions based on a logical expression:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [0, 2, 4]})

df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        A,
        B,
        CASE
            WHEN A > B THEN A
            ELSE B
        END AS A_if_bigger_else_B
    FROM df
""")

df.collect()

Output

╭───────┬───────┬────────────────────╮

This is a useful expression for cleaning your data!

Temporal Expressions#
Daft provides rich support for working with temporal data types like Timestamp and Duration. Let's explore some common temporal operations:

Basic Temporal Operations#
You can perform arithmetic operations with timestamps and durations, such as adding a duration to a timestamp or calculating the duration between two timestamps:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

import datetime

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "timestamp": [
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 1, 59),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0),
    ]
})

# Add 10 seconds to each timestamp and calculate duration between timestamps
df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        timestamp,
        timestamp + INTERVAL '10 seconds' as plus_10_seconds,
    FROM df
""")

df.show()

Output

╭───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────╮

Temporal Component Extraction#
The .dt.* method namespace provides extraction methods for the components of a timestamp, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "timestamp": [
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 1, 59),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0),
    ]
})

# Extract year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the timestamp
df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        timestamp,
        year(timestamp) as year,
        month(timestamp) as month,
        day(timestamp) as day,
        hour(timestamp) as hour,
        minute(timestamp) as minute,
        second(timestamp) as second
    FROM df
""")

df.show()

Output

Time Zone Operations#
You can parse strings as timestamps with time zones and convert between different time zones:


🐍 Python
⚙️ SQL

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "timestamp_str": [
        "2021-01-01 00:00:00.123 +0800",
        "2021-01-02 12:30:00.456 +0800"
    ]
})

# Parse the timestamp string with time zone and convert to New York time
df = daft.sql("""
    SELECT
        timestamp_str,
        to_datetime(timestamp_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%.3f %z', 'America/New_York') as ny_time
    FROM df
""")

df.show()

Temporal Truncation#
The .dt.truncate() method allows you to truncate timestamps to specific time units. This can be useful for grouping data by time periods. For example, to truncate timestamps to the nearest hour:


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "timestamp": [
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 7, 0, 1, 1),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 8, 0, 1, 59),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 9, 0, 30, 0),
        datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 10, 1, 59, 59),
    ]
})

# Truncate timestamps to the nearest hour
df = df.with_column(
    "hour_start",
    df["timestamp"].dt.truncate("1 hour")
)

df.show()

Output

Daft can read data from a variety of sources, and write data to many destinations.

Reading Data#
From Files#
DataFrames can be loaded from file(s) on some filesystem, commonly your local filesystem or a remote cloud object store such as AWS S3.

Additionally, Daft can read data from a variety of container file formats, including CSV, line-delimited JSON and Parquet.

Daft supports file paths to a single file, a directory of files, and wildcards. It also supports paths to remote object storage such as AWS S3.


🐍 Python

import daft

# You can read a single CSV file from your local filesystem
df = daft.read_csv("path/to/file.csv")

# You can also read folders of CSV files, or include wildcards to select for patterns of file paths
df = daft.read_csv("path/to/*.csv")

# Other formats such as parquet and line-delimited JSON are also supported
df = daft.read_parquet("path/to/*.parquet")
df = daft.read_json("path/to/*.json")

# Remote filesystems such as AWS S3 are also supported, and can be specified with their protocols
df = daft.read_csv("s3://mybucket/path/to/*.csv")

To learn more about each of these constructors, as well as the options that they support, consult the API documentation on creating DataFrames from files.

From Data Catalogs#
If you use catalogs such as Apache Iceberg or Apache Hudi, you can check out their dedicated integration pages.

From File Paths#
Daft also provides an easy utility to create a DataFrame from globbing a path. You can use the daft.from_glob_path method which will read a DataFrame of globbed filepaths.


🐍 Python

df = daft.from_glob_path("s3://mybucket/path/to/images/*.jpeg")

# +----------+------+-----+
# | name     | size | ... |
# +----------+------+-----+
#   ...

This is especially useful for reading things such as a folder of images or documents into Daft. A common pattern is to then download data from these files into your DataFrame as bytes, using the .url.download() method.

From Memory#
For testing, or small datasets that fit in memory, you may also create DataFrames using Python lists and dictionaries.


🐍 Python

# Create DataFrame using a dictionary of {column_name: list_of_values}
df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": ["foo", "bar", "baz"]})

# Create DataFrame using a list of rows, where each row is a dictionary of {column_name: value}
df = daft.from_pylist([{"A": 1, "B": "foo"}, {"A": 2, "B": "bar"}, {"A": 3, "B": "baz"}])

To learn more, consult the API documentation on creating DataFrames from in-memory data structures.

From Databases#
Daft can also read data from a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Trino, and SQLite using the daft.read_sql method. In order to partition the data, you can specify a partition column, which will allow Daft to read the data in parallel.


🐍 Python

# Read from a PostgreSQL database
uri = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
df = daft.read_sql("SELECT * FROM my_table", uri)

# Read with a partition column
df = daft.read_sql("SELECT * FROM my_table", partition_col="date", uri)

Reading a column of URLs#
Daft provides a convenient way to read data from a column of URLs using the .url.download() method. This is particularly useful when you have a DataFrame with a column containing URLs pointing to external resources that you want to fetch and incorporate into your DataFrame.

Here's an example of how to use this feature:


🐍 Python

# Assume we have a DataFrame with a column named 'image_urls'
df = daft.from_pydict({
    "image_urls": [
        "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
        "https://example.com/image2.jpg",
        "https://example.com/image3.jpg"
    ]
})

# Download the content from the URLs and create a new column 'image_data'
df = df.with_column("image_data", df["image_urls"].url.download())
df.show()

Output

+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| image_urls                         | image_data                         |
| Utf8                               | Binary                             |
+====================================+====================================+
| https://example.com/image1.jpg     | b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF...' |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| https://example.com/image2.jpg     | b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF...' |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| https://example.com/image3.jpg     | b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF...' |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

This approach allows you to efficiently download and process data from a large number of URLs in parallel, leveraging Daft's distributed computing capabilities.

Writing Data#
Writing data will execute your DataFrame and write the results out to the specified backend. The df.write_*(...) methods are used to write DataFrames to files or other destinations.


🐍 Python

# Write to various file formats in a local folder
df.write_csv("path/to/folder/")
df.write_parquet("path/to/folder/")

# Write DataFrame to a remote filesystem such as AWS S3
df.write_csv("s3://mybucket/path/")

Note

Because Daft is a distributed DataFrame library, by default it will produce multiple files (one per partition) at your specified destination. Writing your dataframe is a blocking operation that executes your DataFrame. It will return a new DataFrame that contains the filepaths to the written data.

DataTypes#
All columns in a Daft DataFrame have a DataType (also often abbreviated as dtype).

All elements of a column are of the same dtype, or they can be the special Null value (indicating a missing value).

Daft provides simple DataTypes that are ubiquituous in many DataFrames such as numbers, strings and dates - all the way up to more complex types like tensors and images.

Tip

For a full overview on all the DataTypes that Daft supports, see the DataType API Reference.

Numeric DataTypes#
Numeric DataTypes allows Daft to represent numbers. These numbers can differ in terms of the number of bits used to represent them (8, 16, 32 or 64 bits) and the semantic meaning of those bits (float vs integer vs unsigned integers).

Examples:

DataType.int8(): represents an 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
DataType.float32(): represents a 32-bit float (a float number with about 7 decimal digits of precision)
Columns/expressions with these datatypes can be operated on with many numeric expressions such as + and *.

See also: Numeric Expressions

Logical DataTypes#
The Boolean DataType represents values which are boolean values: True, False or Null.

Columns/expressions with this dtype can be operated on using logical expressions such as & and .if_else().

See also: Logical Expressions

String Types#
Daft has string types, which represent a variable-length string of characters.

As a convenience method, string types also support the + Expression, which has been overloaded to support concatenation of elements between two DataType.string() columns.

DataType.string(): represents a string of UTF-8 characters
DataType.binary(): represents a string of bytes
See also: String Expressions

Temporal DataTypes#
Temporal DataTypes represent data that have to do with time.

Examples:

DataType.date(): represents a Date (year, month and day)
DataType.timestamp(): represents a Timestamp (particular instance in time)
See also: Temporal Expressions

Nested DataTypes#
Nested DataTypes wrap other DataTypes, allowing you to compose types into complex data structures.

Examples:

DataType.list(child_dtype): represents a list where each element is of the child dtype
DataType.struct({"field_name": child_dtype}): represents a structure that has children dtypes, each mapped to a field name
Python DataType#
The DataType.python() DataType represent items that are Python objects.

Warning

Daft does not impose any invariants about what Python types these objects are. To Daft, these are just generic Python objects!

Python is AWESOME because it's so flexible, but it's also slow and memory inefficient! Thus we recommend:

Cast early!: Casting your Python data into native Daft DataTypes if possible - this results in much more efficient downstream data serialization and computation.
Use Python UDFs: If there is no suitable Daft representation for your Python objects, use Python UDFs to process your Python data and extract the relevant data to be returned as native Daft DataTypes!
Note

If you work with Python classes for a generalizable use-case (e.g. documents, protobufs), it may be that these types are good candidates for "promotion" into a native Daft type! Please get in touch with the Daft team and we would love to work together on building your type into canonical Daft types.

Complex DataTypes#
Daft supports many more interesting complex DataTypes, for example:

DataType.tensor(): Multi-dimensional (potentially uniformly-shaped) tensors of data
DataType.embedding(): Lower-dimensional vector representation of data (e.g. words)
DataType.image(): NHWC images
Daft abstracts away the in-memory representation of your data and provides kernels for many common operations on top of these data types. For supported image operations see the image expressions API reference. For more complex algorithms, you can also drop into a Python UDF to process this data using your custom Python libraries.

Please add suggestions for new DataTypes to our Github Discussions page!

SQL#
Daft supports Structured Query Language (SQL) as a way of constructing query plans (represented in Python as a daft.DataFrame) and expressions (daft.Expression).

SQL is a human-readable way of constructing these query plans, and can often be more ergonomic than using DataFrames for writing queries.

Daft's SQL support is new and is constantly being improved on!

Please give us feedback or submit an issue and we'd love to hear more about what you would like.

Running SQL on DataFrames#
Daft's daft.sql function will automatically detect any daft.DataFrame objects in your current Python environment to let you query them easily by name.


⚙️ SQL

# Note the variable name `my_special_df`
my_special_df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [1, 2, 3]})

# Use the SQL table name "my_special_df" to refer to the above DataFrame!
sql_df = daft.sql("SELECT A, B FROM my_special_df")

sql_df.show()

Output

╭───────┬───────╮
│ A     ┆ B     │
│ ---   ┆ ---   │
│ Int64 ┆ Int64 │
╞═══════╪═══════╡

├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 3     ┆ 3     │
╰───────┴───────╯

(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
In the above example, we query the DataFrame called "my_special_df" by simply referring to it in the SQL command. This produces a new DataFrame sql_df which can natively integrate with the rest of your Daft query.

Reading data from SQL#
Warning

This feature is a WIP and will be coming soon! We will support reading common datasources directly from SQL:


🐍 Python

daft.sql("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('s3://...')")
daft.sql("SELECT * FROM read_delta_lake('s3://...')")

Today, a workaround for this is to construct your dataframe in Python first and use it from SQL instead:


🐍 Python

df = daft.read_parquet("s3://...")
daft.sql("SELECT * FROM df")

We appreciate your patience with us and hope to deliver this crucial feature soon!

SQL Expressions#
SQL has the concept of expressions as well. Here is an example of a simple addition expression, adding columns "a" and "b" in SQL to produce a new column C.

We also present here the equivalent query for SQL and DataFrame. Notice how similar the concepts are!


⚙️ SQL
🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [1, 2, 3]})
df = daft.sql("SELECT A + B as C FROM df")
df.show()

Output

╭───────╮
│ C     │
│ ---   │
│ Int64 │
╞═══════╡
│ 2     │
├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 4     │
├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ 6     │
╰───────╯

(Showing first 3 of 3 rows)
In the above query, both the SQL version of the query and the DataFrame version of the query produce the same result.

Under the hood, they run the same Expression col("A") + col("B")!

One really cool trick you can do is to use the daft.sql_expr function as a helper to easily create Expressions. The following are equivalent:


⚙️ SQL
🐍 Python

sql_expr = daft.sql_expr("A + B as C")
print("SQL expression:", sql_expr)

Output

SQL expression: col(A) + col(B) as C
Python expression: col(A) + col(B) as C
This means that you can pretty much use SQL anywhere you use Python expressions, making Daft extremely versatile at mixing workflows which leverage both SQL and Python.

As an example, consider the filter query below and compare the two equivalent Python and SQL queries:


⚙️ SQL
🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [1, 2, 3]})

# Daft automatically converts this string using `daft.sql_expr`
df = df.where("A < 2")

df.show()

Output

╭───────┬───────╮
│ A     ┆ B     │
│ ---   ┆ ---   │
│ Int64 ┆ Int64 │
╞═══════╪═══════╡
│ 1     ┆ 1     │
╰───────┴───────╯

(Showing first 1 of 1 rows)
Pretty sweet! Of course, this support for running Expressions on your columns extends well beyond arithmetic as we'll see in the next section on SQL Functions.

SQL Functions#
SQL also has access to all of Daft's powerful daft.Expression functionality through SQL functions.

However, unlike the Python Expression API which encourages method-chaining (e.g. col("a").url.download().image.decode()), in SQL you have to do function nesting instead (e.g. "image_decode(url_download(a))").

Note

A full catalog of the available SQL Functions in Daft is available in the SQL API Docs.

Note that it closely mirrors the Python API, with some function naming differences vs the available Python methods. We also have some aliased functions for ANSI SQL-compliance or familiarity to users coming from other common SQL dialects such as PostgreSQL and SparkSQL to easily find their functionality.

Here is an example of an equivalent function call in SQL vs Python:


⚙️ SQL
🐍 Python

df = daft.from_pydict({"urls": [
    "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17691182/190476440-28f29e87-8e3b-41c4-9c28-e112e595f558.png",

]})
df = daft.sql("SELECT image_decode(url_download(urls)) FROM df")
df.show()

Aggregations and Grouping#
Some operations such as the sum or the average of a column are called aggregations. Aggregations are operations that reduce the number of rows in a column.

Global Aggregations#
An aggregation can be applied on an entire DataFrame, for example to get the mean on a specific column:


🐍 Python

import daft

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "class": ["a", "a", "b", "b"],
    "score": [10, 20., 30., 40],
})

df.mean("score").show()

Output

╭─────────╮
│ score   │
│ ---     │
│ Float64 │
╞═════════╡
│ 25      │
╰─────────╯

(Showing first 1 of 1 rows)
For a full list of available Dataframe aggregations, see Aggregations.

Aggregations can also be mixed and matched across columns, via the agg method:


🐍 Python

df.agg(
    df["score"].mean().alias("mean_score"),
    df["score"].max().alias("max_score"),
    df["class"].count().alias("class_count"),
).show()

Output

╭────────────┬───────────┬─────────────╮
│ mean_score ┆ max_score ┆ class_count │
│ ---        ┆ ---       ┆ ---         │

╰────────────┴───────────┴─────────────╯

(Showing first 1 of 1 rows)
For a full list of available aggregation expressions, see Aggregation Expressions

Grouped Aggregations#
Aggregations can also be called on a "Grouped DataFrame". For the above example, perhaps we want to get the mean "score" not for the entire DataFrame, but for each "class".

Let's run the mean of column "score" again, but this time grouped by "class":


🐍 Python

df.groupby("class").mean("score").show()

Output

╭───────┬─────────╮
│ class ┆ score   │
│ ---   ┆ ---     │
│ Utf8  ┆ Float64 │
╞═══════╪═════════╡

├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┼╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤
│ b     ┆ 35      │
╰───────┴─────────╯

(Showing first 2 of 2 rows)
To run multiple aggregations on a Grouped DataFrame, you can use the agg method:


🐍 Python

df.groupby("class").agg(
    df["score"].mean().alias("mean_score"),
    df["score"].max().alias("max_score"),
).show()

Output

╭───────┬────────────┬───────────╮

Cross Column Aggregations#
While standard aggregations like sum or mean work vertically on a single column, Daft also provides functions to operate horizontally across multiple columns for each row. These functions are part of the daft.functions module and include:

columns_min: Find the minimum value across specified columns for each row
columns_max: Find the maximum value across specified columns for each row
columns_mean: Calculate the mean across specified columns for each row
columns_sum: Calculate the sum across specified columns for each row
columns_avg: Alias for columns_mean
Here's a simple example showing these functions in action:


🐍 Python

import daft
from daft.functions import columns_min, columns_max, columns_mean, columns_sum

df = daft.from_pydict({
    "a": [1, 2, 3],
    "b": [4, 5, 6],
    "c": [7, 8, 9]
})

# Create new columns with cross-column aggregations
df = df.with_columns({
    "min_value": columns_min("a", "b", "c"),
    "max_value": columns_max("a", "b", "c"),
    "mean_value": columns_mean("a", "b", "c"),
    "sum_value": columns_sum("a", "b", "c")
})

df.show()

Output

These functions are especially useful when you need to calculate statistics across related columns or find extreme values from multiple fields in your data.

User-Defined Functions (UDF)#
A key piece of functionality in Daft is the ability to flexibly define custom functions that can run computations on any data in your dataframe. This section walks you through the different types of UDFs that Daft allows you to run.

Let's first create a dataframe that will be used as a running example throughout this tutorial!


🐍 Python

import daft
import numpy as np

df = daft.from_pydict({
    # the `image` column contains images represented as 2D numpy arrays
    "image": [np.ones((128, 128)) for i in range(16)],
    # the `crop` column contains a box to crop from our image, represented as a list of integers: [x1, x2, y1, y2]
    "crop": [[0, 1, 0, 1] for i in range(16)],
})

Per-column per-row functions using .apply#
You can use .apply to run a Python function on every row in a column.

For example, the following example creates a new flattened_image column by calling .flatten() on every object in the image column.


🐍 Python

df.with_column(
    "flattened_image",
    df["image"].apply(lambda img: img.flatten(), return_dtype=daft.DataType.python())
).show(2)

Output

+----------------------+---------------+---------------------+
| image                | crop          | flattened_image     |
| Python               | List[Int64]   | Python              |
+======================+===============+=====================+
| [[1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. | [0, 1, 0, 1]  | [1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. |
| 1.]  [1. 1. 1. ...   |               | 1.]                 |
| 1. 1. 1.]  [1. 1.... |               |                     |
+----------------------+---------------+---------------------+
| [[1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. | [0, 1, 0, 1]  | [1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. |
| 1.]  [1. 1. 1. ...   |               | 1.]                 |
| 1. 1. 1.]  [1. 1.... |               |                     |
+----------------------+---------------+---------------------+
(Showing first 2 rows)
Note here that we use the return_dtype keyword argument to specify that our returned column type is a Python column!

Multi-column per-partition functions using @udf#
.apply is great for convenience, but has two main limitations:

It can only run on single columns
It can only run on single items at a time
Daft provides the @udf decorator for defining your own UDFs that process multiple columns or multiple rows at a time.

For example, let's try writing a function that will crop all our images in the image column by its corresponding value in the crop column:


🐍 Python

@daft.udf(return_dtype=daft.DataType.python())
def crop_images(images, crops, padding=0):
    cropped = []
    for img, crop in zip(images, crops):
        x1, x2, y1, y2 = crop
        cropped_img = img[x1:x2 + padding, y1:y2 + padding]
        cropped.append(cropped_img)
    return cropped

df = df.with_column(
    "cropped",
    crop_images(df["image"], df["crop"], padding=1),
)
df.show(2)

Output

+----------------------+---------------+--------------------+
| image                | crop          | cropped            |
| Python               | List[Int64]   | Python             |
+======================+===============+====================+
| [[1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. | [0, 1, 0, 1]  | [[1. 1.]  [1. 1.]] |
| 1.]  [1. 1. 1. ...   |               |                    |
| 1. 1. 1.]  [1. 1.... |               |                    |
+----------------------+---------------+--------------------+
| [[1. 1. 1. ... 1. 1. | [0, 1, 0, 1]  | [[1. 1.]  [1. 1.]] |
| 1.]  [1. 1. 1. ...   |               |                    |
| 1. 1. 1.]  [1. 1.... |               |                    |
+----------------------+---------------+--------------------+

There's a few things happening here, let's break it down:

crop_images is a normal Python function. It takes as input:

a. A list of images: images

b. A list of cropping boxes: crops

c. An integer indicating how much padding to apply to the right and bottom of the cropping: padding

To allow Daft to pass column data into the images and crops arguments, we decorate the function with @udf

a. return_dtype defines the returned data type. In this case, we return a column containing Python objects of numpy arrays

b. At runtime, because we call the UDF on the image and crop columns, the UDF will receive a daft.Series object for each argument.

We can create a new column in our DataFrame by applying our UDF on the "image" and "crop" columns inside of a df.with_column() call.

UDF Inputs#
When you specify an Expression as an input to a UDF, Daft will calculate the result of that Expression and pass it into your function as a daft.Series object.

The Daft daft.Series is just an abstraction on a "column" of data! You can obtain several different data representations from a daft.Series:

PyArrow Arrays (pa.Array): s.to_arrow()
Python lists (list): s.to_pylist()
Depending on your application, you may choose a different data representation that is more performant or more convenient!

Info

Certain array formats have some restrictions around the type of data that they can handle:

Null Handling: In Pandas and Numpy, nulls are represented as NaNs for numeric types, and Nones for non-numeric types. Additionally, the existence of nulls will trigger a type casting from integer to float arrays. If null handling is important to your use-case, we recommend using one of the other available options.

Python Objects: PyArrow array formats cannot support Python columns.

We recommend using Python lists if performance is not a major consideration, and using the arrow-native formats such as PyArrow arrays and numpy arrays if performance is important.

Return Types#
The return_dtype argument specifies what type of column your UDF will return. Types can be specified using the daft.DataType class.

Your UDF function itself needs to return a batch of columnar data, and can do so as any one of the following array types:

Numpy Arrays (np.ndarray)
PyArrow Arrays (pa.Array)
Python lists (list)
Note that if the data you have returned is not castable to the return_dtype that you specify (e.g. if you return a list of floats when you've specified a return_dtype=DataType.bool()), Daft will throw a runtime error!

Class UDFs#
UDFs can also be created on Classes, which allow for initialization on some expensive state that can be shared between invocations of the class, for example downloading data or creating a model.


🐍 Python

@daft.udf(return_dtype=daft.DataType.int64())
class RunModel:

    def __init__(self):
        # Perform expensive initializations
        self._model = create_model()

    def __call__(self, features_col):
        return self._model(features_col)

Running Class UDFs are exactly the same as running their functional cousins.


🐍 Python

df = df.with_column("image_classifications", RunModel(df["images"]))

Resource Requests#
Sometimes, you may want to request for specific resources for your UDF. For example, some UDFs need one GPU to run as they will load a model onto the GPU.

To do so, you can create your UDF and assign it a resource request:


🐍 Python

@daft.udf(return_dtype=daft.DataType.int64(), num_gpus=1)
class RunModelWithOneGPU:

    def __init__(self):
        # Perform expensive initializations
        self._model = create_model()

    def __call__(self, features_col):
        return self._model(features_col)

df = df.with_column(
    "image_classifications",
    RunModelWithOneGPU(df["images"]),
)

In the above example, if Daft ran on a Ray cluster consisting of 8 GPUs and 64 CPUs, Daft would be able to run 8 replicas of your UDF in parallel, thus massively increasing the throughput of your UDF!

UDFs can also be parametrized with new resource requests after being initialized.


🐍 Python

RunModelWithTwoGPUs = RunModelWithOneGPU.override_options(num_gpus=2)
df = df.with_column(
    "image_classifications",
    RunModelWithTwoGPUs(df["images"]),
)

Example: UDFs in ML Workloads#
We'll define a function that uses a pre-trained PyTorch model: ResNet50 to classify the dog pictures. We'll pass the contents of the image urls column and send the classification predictions to a new column classify_breed.

Working with PyTorch adds some complexity but you can just run the cells below to perform the classification.

First, make sure to install and import some extra dependencies:


%pip install validators matplotlib Pillow torch torchvision

🐍 Python

# import additional libraries, these are necessary for PyTorch
import torch

Define your ClassifyImages UDF. Models are expensive to initialize and load, so we want to do this as few times as possible, and share a model across multiple invocations.


🐍 Python

@udf(return_dtype=DataType.fixed_size_list(dtype=DataType.string(), size=2))
class ClassifyImages:
    def __init__(self):
        # Perform expensive initializations - create and load the pre-trained model
        self.model = torch.hub.load("NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub", "nvidia_resnet50", pretrained=True)
        self.utils = torch.hub.load("NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub", "nvidia_convnets_processing_utils")
        self.model.eval().to(torch.device("cpu"))

    def __call__(self, images_urls):
        batch = torch.cat([self.utils.prepare_input_from_uri(uri) for uri in images_urls]).to(torch.device("cpu"))

        with torch.no_grad():
            output = torch.nn.functional.softmax(self.model(batch), dim=1)

        results = self.utils.pick_n_best(predictions=output, n=1)
        return [result[0] for result in results]

Now you're ready to call this function on the urls column and store the outputs in a new column we'll call classify_breed:


🐍 Python

classified_images_df = df_family.with_column("classify_breed", ClassifyImages(daft.col("urls")))
classified_images_df.select("dog_name", "image", "classify_breed").show()

Multimodal Data#
Daft is built to work comfortably with multimodal data types, including URLs and images. You can use the url.download() expression to download the bytes from a URL. Let's store them in a new column using the with_column method:


🐍 Python

df_family = df_family.with_column("image_bytes", df_dogs["urls"].url.download(on_error="null"))
df_family.show()

Let's turn the bytes into human-readable images using image.decode():


🐍 Python

df_family = df_family.with_column("image", daft.col("image_bytes").image.decode())
df_family.show()
